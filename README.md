The Maze-to-Graph project is a versatile Python application hosted on GitHub that empowers users to design custom mazes or generate random mazes. Once a maze is created, the project leverages the power of NetworkX to seamlessly convert it into a graph representation. This innovative tool extends its functionality by implementing various artificial intelligence algorithms, including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Greedy, and A* (A-star), to solve the maze efficiently.
